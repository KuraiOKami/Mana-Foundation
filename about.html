        <h2>Our story</h2>
        <p>
          Mana Foundation began as a grassroots meal distribution effort organized by friends and neighbors in Orlando.
          As storms intensified and housing costs soared, we formalized as a nonprofit to provide sustained relief and
          long-term recovery for families across Central Florida. Today, we coordinate statewide coalitions, deploy
          mobile pantry units, and invest in policy advocacy to make Florida safer and more equitable for everyone.
